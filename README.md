## About Study-AId
Study-AId is a Streamlit app integrated with a user authentication and an AI chatbot than ran off of the GPT3.5 Turbo LLM that allows users to upload and "chat" with their pdf's.
The purpose of this project is to compete in Pre-University Matriculation Innovation Competition 2024 (PITRAM). Ultimately, the biggest aspiration for this project is to provide a service to students all around the country. With this chatbot, I wish to help students learn more effectively, manage time wisely, and overall get a good outcome from their study sessions.

## Fun Facts about Study-AId:
1. The use of two different databases : cloud relational database and cloud vector database
2. The databases / similarity search AI used was Deta Cloud and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
3. OpenAI and Langchain played a major role in this project
4. The embeddings model for the Vectors came from OpenAi and also the chatbot uses OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo
5. Langchain's Q&A model was used to ease student's enquiry input and etc.

This project was a team effort and I am happy to share that we won a gold medal in that innovation competition.
